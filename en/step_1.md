## Introduction

You will create a digital card to send to someone to cheer them up or help them celebrate an occasion, or for any other reason — it's up to you! You will decide who you will make the card for, and to help you develop your ideas, you will investigate cards that other people have made.

You have a range of skills that you learned in the Look after yourself pathway.

### What you will make

In this project, you will choose some of those skills and use them to independently make your own original digital card.

Before you start this project, we recommend that you complete the first three Skills projects in the [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/look-after-yourself){:target="_blank"} pathway: 
+ [Stress ball](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/stress-ball){:target="_blank"}
+ [Butterfly garden](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/butterfly-garden){:target="_blank"}
+ [Serene scene](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/serene-scene){:target="_blank"}

Also, we recommend that you complete the two Design projects:
+ [Interactive animation](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/interactive-animation){:target="_blank"}
+ [3D scene](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/3D-scene){:target="_blank"}

For this project, you need to know how to:  
+ Add code to sprites and a backdrop
+ Customise sprites in the Paint editor
+ Add `graphic effects`{:class="block3looks"}, `motion`{:class="block3motion"}, and `sound`{:class="block3sound"} to a sprite

+ Use the `next costume`{:class="block3looks"} and `wait`{:class="block3control"} blocks to animate a sprite
+ Make a `variable`{:class="block3variables"}, turn it into a slider with a range, and use it as an input to a block
+ Use `layers`{:class="block3looks"} blocks to move sprites in front of or behind other sprites
