## Introduction

You will create a digital, interactive card to send to someone to cheer them up or help them celebrate an occasion or for any other reason - it's up to you. You will decide who you will make the card for and, to help you develop your ideas, you will investigate cards that others have made.

You have a range of skills which you have learnt during the Look After Yourself projects.

### What you will make

In this project, you will now choose some of those skills to independently make your very own, original digital card.
