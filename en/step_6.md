## Make
Now you're going to make your digital card project. 

You need to break up your project up into smaller parts so you can develop each part, one at a time. In computing, this process is called **decomposition**.

--- task ---
If you haven't already chosen a backdrop and added sprites then start now. You can use costumes and backdrops from the libraries or use the Paint editor to create your own. 

Add the basic sprites that you think you need for your digital card. Don't worry you can always change, delete or add more sprites later as you develop your ideas. 

You don't need to add everything at once. For instance, you might want to add code to one sprite before you paint a costume for another.

What will your first sprite do? You need to think about **what** you want your sprite to do and **when** it will do it. 

Describe what the sprite will do in words. Tell a friend or family member.

Examples:
"When you click the green flag the donut will start bouncing around"
"When you click on the penguin it will get the fisheye effect and play a whistle sound"
"2 seconds after clicking the green flag the squirrel will make a squeak sound and start bouncing around"
"When you click on the number 1 it will get brighter"
"When you click on the green flag the THANK YOU message will switch between bigger and smaller sizes"

You might have lots of ideas. Just choose one of them to start with.

Add the blocks for **when** your sprite should do something. 

```blocks3
when green flag clicked

when this sprite clicked

```

These blocks have a different shape, they are sometimes called **Hat blocks** and they start code running when a particular event happens. 

You could also use a `wait`{:class="block3control"} block to add a delay before running other blocks.

And you may need a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop that keeps running blocks.

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
forever :: control
```

Add the blocks you need to make your sprite do **what** you want it to do. 

Go to blocks you now know and use a [How to...](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/digital-card/4){:target=”_blank”} to remind yourself what you can do.

**Tip:** Have a go. Your computer won’t break!

**Tip:** Some of the best ideas come from playing. You will come across good ideas by accident.

**Tip**: You can add code to the backdrop too.

Use snippets of information to remind yourself how to do useful things in Scratch with the [Getting started with Scratch](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-scratch) guide.

Test your new code. Is it running as you imagined? Here are some useful debugging tips:

+ You can click on block in the Menu and run it. You could try some `graphic effects`{:class="block3looks"} blocks to see what you like and then use `clear graphic effects`{:class="block3looks"} to make your sprite normal again.

+ You can drag some of your blocks away from the script but keep them within the Code area and add them back one at a time to help you understand what your code is doing.

Show someone else your project and tell them what you’ve done and what your plans are. Ask for their honest feedback. You might want to improve your project based on their feedback.
--- /task ---

**Tip:** It’s ok to change your mind but always be clear about what you’re aiming for.

--- task ---
What’s your next step? It might be to develop the sprites’s behaviour. It might be to add code to another sprite. 

Are you stuck for ideas? Don’t forget to look at step 3: [Investigate](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/digital-card/2){:target=”_blank”} and `See inside`{:class="block3motion"} some projects.

If you have finished or don't have much time left then carry on to the next step to share your card.
