## Investigate digital cards
The digital card that you make will be different to the ones that other people have made. You will decide what it will look like, which sprites, costumes and backdrops used and what happens when you click on the stage or on the sprites. 

Looking at projects that other people have made is a good way to get started.

Take a look at the [Interactive cards Scratch studio](). These projects have all been made using blocks and skills that you have learned in the Looking after yourself pathway.

Have a look ‘inside’ to see how they have been created.
