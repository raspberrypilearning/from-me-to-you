## Investigate digital cards
The digital card that you make will be different to the ones that other people have made. You will decide what it will look like, which sprites, costumes and backdrops used and importanatly, what interaction the card will have i.e. what happens when you click on the green flag, the stage, on the sprites etc.

Looking at projects that other people have made is a good way to get started.

**OR PABLO RATHER THAN LOOK AT A PUBLIC SCRATCH PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLES WE COULD CREATE A STUDIO WHICH PEPLE TRIALLING THE LEARNING JOURNEY COULD ADD THEIR PROJECTS TO.

THE ONES WITH THE LINKS ABOVE COULD BE USING SOME THINGS THAT THE  LEARNERS HAVE NOT BEEN INTRODUCED TO...

**IF BELOW THEN PABLOE PL ADD YOUR EMBEDDED SCRATCH PROJECT CODE HERE **

Take a look at the [Interactive cards Scratch studio](). These projects have all been made using blocks and skills that you have learnt in the Looking after yourself pathway.

Have a look ‘inside’ to see how they have been created.
