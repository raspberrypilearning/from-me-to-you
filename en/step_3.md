## Investigate digital cards
The digital card that you make will be different to the ones that other people have made. You will decide what it will look like, which sprites, costumes and backdrops used and importanatly, what interaction the card will have i.e. what happens when you click on the green flag, the stage, on the sprites etc.

Looking at projects that other people have made is a good way to get started. 

Explore some of the many [digital cards](https://scratch.mit.edu/search/projects?q=digital%20card) and [interactive cards](https://scratch.mit.edu/search/projects?q=interactive%20card) created by others in Scratch.

**PABLE DO WE WANT  TO ADD A STUDIO OF EXAMPLES. MY FEELING IS THIS  IS WHERE THEY EXPLORE OTHER PROJECTS. IF THEEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SKILLS USED THEN THEY MAY WELL NOT USE THE PROJECT.**
**OR ADD YOUR EMBEDDED TEXT HERE**

Take a look at the [Interactive cards Scratch studio](). These projects have all been made using blocks and skills that you have learnt in the Looking after yourself pathway.

Have a look ‘inside’ to see how they have been created.
