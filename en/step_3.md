## Get inspiration

The digital card that you make will be different to the cards that other people have made because you are creating an original project. You can look at projects that other people have made, to help you start to think of your own ideas.

Look at some digital card projects that have been made using skills that you learned in the [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/look-after-yourself) pathway.

Whilst you explore the projects, ask yourself:
+ Can you tell what message is being sent? 
+ How does the user access the text and/or audio message?

Is it easy to know what to do? If not, click on **See Project Page** and read the **Instructions** section.

Investigate some digital cards, which you can find in the [Scratch studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27073994){:target="_blank"} or below:
