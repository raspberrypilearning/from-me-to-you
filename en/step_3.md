## Get inspiration

The digital card that you make will be different to the ones that other people have made because you are creating an original project. Looking at projects that other people have made is a good way to get started with your own ideas.

Take a look at some digital card projects that have been made using skills that you have learnt during the Looking after yourself pathway.

Whilst you are exploring, ask yourself:
+ Can you tell what message is being sent? 
+ How does the user access the text or audio message?

Is it easy to know what to do? If not click on the `See Project Page`{:class="block3motion"} to investigate how the projects have been made.

Investigate the [Digital cards](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27073994){:target=”_blank”} in the Scratch studio or try the same projects below:
