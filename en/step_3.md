## Investigate digital cards
The digital card that you make will be different to the ones that other people have made. You will decide what the card will look like and which sprites, costumes and backdrops to you. Importantly, you will decide what interaction the card will have.

Take a look at some Digital card projects that have all been made using skills that you have learnt during the Looking After Yourself projects.
