## Get inspiration

The digital card that you make will be different to the ones that other people have made becuase you are creating an original project. Looking at projects that other people have made though is a good way to get started with your own ideas.

--- task ---

Take a look at some Digital card projects that have been made using skills that you have learnt during the Looking after yourself projects.

Whilst you are exploring, ask yourself:
+ Can you guess who the card been made for? 
+ How has the digital maker communicated the theme?
+ How does the user access the text or audio message?
+ What is the user interaction in the cards? It might be event blocks and/or a variable slider?
