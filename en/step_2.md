## The digital making process

**Digital making** is learning about digital technology by making things. Digital making starts with an idea of something to make or addressing an issue using digital technology.

The **idea** for this project is to send a message to someone particular to let them know you are thinking of them on a special occasion. The message needs to be accessed via a webpage link. Because the message is made in Scratch with graphics, interaction, sound and available to access online, you can think of this message as a **digital card**.

The digital making process looks like this:

+ **imagine** part of your project, you can go straight to Scratch or use paper if you prefer,
+ **make** it using Code, Sounds and the Paint Editor, 
+ **use** it to test and see if it works, you may also want to show someone else and get their feedback,
+ **reflect** on what you have made so far and, 
+ go round again, either improving what you have made so far or adding more.  

**Tip**: It's best to start small and simple and keep adding to your project until you're happy with it or you run out of time. You can always add more later.
