## The digital making process

**Digital making** is learning about digital technology by making things. It starts with an idea of something to make and/or an issue to address.

The **idea** for this project is to send a message to someone in particular to let them know that you are thinking of them. The message will be accessed via a webpage link. Because the message is made in Scratch with graphics, interaction, and sound, and is available to access online, you can think of this message as a **digital card**.

The digital making process looks like this: 

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
forever
imagine :: custom
make :: custom
interact :: custom
```
+ **Imagine** and investigate for part of your project â€” you can go straight to Scratch or use paper if you prefer
+ **Make** it using code, sounds, and the Paint editor
+ **Interact** with it to test and see if it works, reflect on your project, you may also want to show someone else and get their feedback
+ Go round again, either by refining what you have made so far or adding more

**Tip:** It is best to start small and simple and keep adding to your project until you are happy with it or you run out of time. You can always add more later.
