## The digital making process

**Digital making** is learning about digital technology by making things. It starts with an idea of something to make or an issue to address.

The **idea** for this project is to send a message to someone particular to let them know you are thinking of them. The message will be accessed via a webpage link. Because the message is made in Scratch with graphics, interaction, sound and available to access online, you can think of this message as a **digital card**.

The digital making process looks like this: 

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
forever
imagine :: custom
make :: custom
use :: custom
```
+ **imagine** and investigate for part of your project, you can go straight to Scratch or use paper if you prefer,
+ **make** it using Code, Sounds and the Paint Editor, 
+ **use** it to test and see if it works, reflect, you may also want to show someone else and get their feedback,
+ go round again, either improving what you have made so far or adding more.  

**Tip**: It's best to start small and simple and keep adding to your project until you're happy with it or you run out of time. You can always add more later.
