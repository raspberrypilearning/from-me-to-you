## The digital making process

**Digital making** is learning about technology by making things. Digital making starts with an idea of something to make or a problem to be solved. The **idea** for this project is to use Scratch to send a greeting to someone. You can think of this as a 'digital card'.

<mark>Better wording that focuses on the problem? You want to communicate with someone and let them know you are thinking of them. It doesn't have to be a digital card exactly, but there's so much variety in what a digital card can be that this isn't really constraining.</mark> 

The process looks like this:

when I receive [idea]
forever
imagine :: custom
make :: custom
use :: custom
reflect :: custom
```

+ **imagine** part of your project, you can go straight to Scratch or use paper if you prefer,
+ **make** it using Code, Sounds and the Paint Editor, 
+ **use** it to test and see if it works, you may also want to show someone else and get their feedback,
+ **reflect** on what you have made so far and, 
+ go round again, either improving what you have made so far or adding more.  

**Tip**: It's best to start small and simple and keep adding to your project until you're happy with it or you run out of time. You can always add more later.
