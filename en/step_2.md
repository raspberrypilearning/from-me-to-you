## The digital making process

**Digital making** is learning about digital technology by making things. It starts with an idea of something to make and/or an issue to address.

The **idea** for this project is to send a message to someone to let them know that you are thinking of them.  

You will make a **digital card** in Scratch with graphics, interaction, and sound.

You will be able to share your digital card using the **web address** for your Scratch project.

The digital making process looks like this: 

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
forever
imagine :: custom
make :: custom
interact :: custom
```
+ **Imagine** what you will make â€” you can go straight to Scratch or use paper if you prefer
+ **Make** it using code, sounds, and the Paint editor
+ **Interact** with it to **test** and see if it works, show someone else and get their feedback, **reflect** on what you have made and learnt, 
+ Go round again, make improvements or add more

**Tip:** Start small and simple and keep adding to your project until you are happy with it or you run out of time.
