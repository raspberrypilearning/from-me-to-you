## The digital making process

**Digital making** is learning about technology by making things. Digital making starts with an idea of something to make, the idea for this project is an interactive card that you can send to someone. It's best to start small and simple and keep adding to your project until you're happy with it.  

The process looks like this:

```blocks3

```

For each part of your project, you'll have to think really carefully about what you want it to do, then you'll need to develop it and improve it.

You'll keep repeating the loop to improve your project until you're happy with it or you run out of time.
