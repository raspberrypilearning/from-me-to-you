## Make ðŸ§± and test ðŸ”„

Now, it's time to make your digital card. Start small, and add more to your project if you have time. 

**Tip:** Remember to test your project each time you add something. It is much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.

![A strip of example projects including cards for world hello day, new year, world environment day, a thank you card and a happy birthday card..](images/showcase_static.png)

For this project, you need to know how to:  
+ Add code to sprites and a backdrop
+ Customise sprites in the Paint editor
+ Add `graphic effects`{:class="block3looks"}, `motion`{:class="block3motion"}, and `sound`{:class="block3sound"} to a sprite
+ Use the `forever`{:class="block3control"} block
+ Use the `next costume`{:class="block3looks"} and `wait`{:class="block3control"} blocks to animate a sprite
+ Make a `variable`{:class="block3variables"}, turn it into a slider with a range, and use it as an input to a block
+ Use `layers`{:class="block3looks"} blocks to move sprites in front of or behind other sprites





--- task ---
If you have not already chosen a backdrop and added a sprite, then start now. You can always add more later, including using the Paint editor to make your own.

Think about **what** you want to say in your message in your digital card.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Now, think about **how** you will say your message. You can add your message as either a **sprite/sprites** or a **sound**.

You can go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Letters** from the Sprite Library or search for `numbers`:
![Show Choose a Sprite letters/numbers](images/from-me-letters-numbers.png){:width="300px"}

You could use the **Text** tool in the Paint editor to write a short message: 

--- collapse ---
---
title: Use the Text tool in the Paint editor
---

Click on the **Fill** colour chooser and select the first colour that you want for your text:
![Show Fill colour](images/from-me-fill-colour.png){:width="150px"}

Select the **Text** tool:
![Show Text tool](images/from-me-text-tool.png){:width="150px"}

Click on the Paint editor and start typing.

Click on the drop-down menu and select the font that you want:
![Show Font](images/from-me-text-font.png){:width="300px"}

Click on the **Select (Arrow)** tool and select your text. Drag the corner handles to resize your text:
![Show Arrow tool and resize handles](images/from-me-arrow-resize.png){:width="300px"}

Do you want to change the **Fill** colour? Select the **Fill (Bucket)** tool and hover over your text. It will automatically change colour. Click on the text to make the change:
![Show Fill (bucket) tool](images/from-me-fill-bucket.png){:width="150px"}

If you want each word in your message to be a different colour, size, and font, then follow the process above for each word in your message.

Position your text and/or group of words with the cross hairs in the centre of the Paint editor:
![Show crosshair](images/from-me-paint-editor-centre.png){:width="400px"}

To layer your words, use the **Forward** and **Backward** tools:
![Show forward/backward](images/from-me-paint-editor-forward-backward.png){:width="400px"}

--- /collapse ---

You can also use any other skill and tool in the Paint editor that you have learned about:

+ [Paint editor](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-scratch/9){:target="scratch_guide"}

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Do you need to add sounds to a **sprite** or to the **Stage**?

You can record a spoken message if you like:

--- collapse ---
---
title: Record a sound
---

Select the sprite that you want to add recorded sound to. Click on its **Sounds** tab, go to the menu in the bottom left-hand corner, and select **Record**:
![Show Record](images/from-me-record.png){:width="200px"}

To start recording, click the red circle button:
![Show play Record](images/from-me-start-sound.png){:width="200px"}

To stop recording, click the red square button:
![Show stop  Record](images/from-me-stop-sound.png){:width="200px"}

You can now **Re-record**, **Play** the recording, and/or **Save** your sound.

Name your sound:
![Show name sound](images/from-me-name-sound.png){:width="300px"}

--- /task ---

Now, think about how the user will interact with your project.

For example:
+ "When the user clicks on the green flag, a sprite moves"

+ "When the user clicks on a sprite, the sprite changes colour"

**Tip:** Write down your main idea or tell a friend or family member. It is easier to make a project when you can explain what your idea is.

You might have lots of other ideas. Save them for later.

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Add a block for **when** your sprite should do something.

--- collapse ---
---
title: Start code with Hat blocks
---

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
when this sprite clicked
```

These blocks have a different shape â€” they are sometimes called **Hat blocks**. They start code running when a particular event happens, such as a user clicking.

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add the blocks that you need to make your sprite do **what** you want it to do.

Choose the blocks that you need and drag them underneath a Hat block. Put blocks inside a `forever`{:class="block3control"} block if you want them to keep running.

![Example code blocks](images/example-code-blocks.png)

You can use any of the skills that you have learned:

+ [Motion](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-scratch/5){:target="scratch_guide"}
+ [Looks](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-scratch/6){:target="scratch_guide"}
+ [Sound](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-scratch/7){:target="scratch_guide"}
+ [Variables](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-scratch/8){:target="scratch_guide"}

--- /task ---

**Tip:** Some of the best ideas come from playing. You will find good ideas by accident.

--- task ---
Test your new code. Is it running as you imagined? 

**Debugging** is finding and fixing mistakes in your code that are called **bugs**.

--- collapse ---
---

title: Debugging tips

---

+ **My sprite is going upside down** â€” Add a `set rotation style left-right`{:class="block3motion"} or `set rotation style don't rotate`{:class="block3motion"} block.

+ **My sprite 'jumps' when it changes costume or bounces** â€” Make sure that the costume is centred in the Paint editor (line up the blue cross with the cross hairs in the centre of the Paint editor).

+ **My sprite stops when it gets to the edge of the Stage** â€” Add an `if on edge, bounce`{:class="block3motion"} block.

+ **My sound does not play** â€” Have you added a block to `play sound`{:class="block3sound"} when the sprite is clicked? If you have copied code from another sprite, you will need to add the sound to this sprite from the **Sounds** tab. Check the volume on your computer and make sure that you have not lowered the volume with code â€” try `set volume to`{:class="block3sound"}`100`.

+ **Other sprites keep going in front of my sprite** â€” Use a `go to front layer`{:class="block3looks"} block.

+ **My sprite only moves/changes once** â€” Put your code inside a `forever`{:class="block3control"}Â block so it keeps running.

+ **My sprite does not change when I move a variable slider** â€” Put your code inside a `forever`{:class="block3control"}Â block so it keeps updating.

Show someone else your project. Ask for their honest feedback. Can you make improvements?

--- /task ---

**Tip:** It's OK to change your mind, but always be clear about what you want to make.

--- task ---
What is your next step? It might be to add more code to your sprite. It might be to add code to another sprite. It might be to record a sound or create a new costume in the Paint editor. 

Are you stuck for ideas? Don't forget to look at step 3: [Get inspiration](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/from-me-to-you/2){:target="_blank"} and **See inside** some projects.

If you have finished or don't have much time left, then move on to the next step to share your digital card.
