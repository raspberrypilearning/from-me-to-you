## Make üß± and test üîÑ

Now, it's time to make your digital card. Start small, and add more to your project if you have time. 

**Tip:** Remember to test your project each time you add something. It is much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.

![A strip of example projects including cards for world hello day, new year, world environment day, a thank you card and a happy birthday card..](images/showcase_static.png)

Some useful skills you could use for your card:  
+ Add code to sprites and a backdrop
+ Customise sprites in the Paint editor
+ Add `graphic effects`{:class="block3looks"}, `motion`{:class="block3motion"}, and `sound`{:class="block3sound"} to a sprite
+ Use the `forever`{:class="block3control"} and `repeat`{:class="block3control"} loop blocks
+ Use the `next costume`{:class="block3looks"} and `wait`{:class="block3control"} blocks to animate a sprite
+ Use `layers`{:class="block3looks"} blocks to move sprites in front of or behind other sprites
+ Use the `text to speech` and `translate` extensions

Add the backdrop and new sprites you need for this page.

### For each sprite üêà üê¢ üéà

--- task ---

You will need to add code to each character and object sprite in your book. Consider whether they will do anything when the project starts, when the backdrop switches to a particular page or when the sprite is clicked. 

```blocks3
when flag clicked

when this sprite clicked

when backdrop switches to [page v]
```

### Your message

--- task ---

 **How** you will say your message. You can add your message as either a **sprite/sprites** or a **sound**.

You can go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Letters** from the Sprite Library or search for `numbers`:
![Show Choose a Sprite letters/numbers](images/from-me-letters-numbers.png){:width="300px"}

You could use the **Text** tool in the Paint editor to write a short message: 

[[[scratch3-use-text-tool]]]

You can record a spoken message if you like:

Now, think about how the user will interact with your project.

For example:
+ "When the user clicks on the green flag, a sprite moves"

+ "When the user clicks on a sprite, the sprite changes colour"

**Tip:** Write down your main idea or tell a friend or family member. It is easier to make a project when you can explain what your idea is.

You might have lots of other ideas. Save them for later.

--- task ---
Add a block for **when** your sprite should do something.

--- collapse ---
---
title: Start code with Hat blocks
---

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
when this sprite clicked
```

These blocks have a different shape ‚Äî they are sometimes called **Hat blocks**. They start code running when a particular event happens, such as a user clicking.

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add the blocks that you need to make your sprite do **what** you want it to do.

Choose the blocks that you need and drag them underneath a Hat block. Put blocks inside a `forever`{:class="block3control"} block if you want them to keep running.

**Tip:** Some of the best ideas come from playing. You will find good ideas by accident.

--- task ---

**Test:** üîÑ Show someone else your project and ask for üó£Ô∏è their feedback. Do you want to make any changes to your book? 

‚è±Ô∏è If you have time, you can upgrade your project. 

üí° You could:
- Add more code to your sprites
- Add another sprite
- Add another page
- Record a sound 
- Create a new costume in the Paint editor

**Debugging** is finding and fixing mistakes in your code that are called **bugs** üêû. 

You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs:

---

title: Debugging tips

---

+ **My sprite is going upside down** ‚Äî Add a `set rotation style left-right`{:class="block3motion"} or `set rotation style don't rotate`{:class="block3motion"} block.

+ **My sprite 'jumps' when it changes costume or bounces** ‚Äî Make sure that the costume is centred in the Paint editor (line up the blue cross with the cross hairs in the centre of the Paint editor).

+ **My sprite stops when it gets to the edge of the Stage** ‚Äî Add an `if on edge, bounce`{:class="block3motion"} block.

+ **My sound does not play** ‚Äî Have you added a block to `play sound`{:class="block3sound"} when the sprite is clicked? If you have copied code from another sprite, you will need to add the sound to this sprite from the **Sounds** tab. Check the volume on your computer and make sure that you have not lowered the volume with code ‚Äî try `set volume to`{:class="block3sound"}`100`.

+ **Other sprites keep going in front of my sprite** ‚Äî Use a `go to front layer`{:class="block3looks"} block.

+ **My sprite only moves/changes once** ‚Äî Put your code inside a `forever`{:class="block3control"}¬†block so it keeps running.

+ **My sprite does not change when I move a variable slider** ‚Äî Put your code inside a `forever`{:class="block3control"}¬†block so it keeps updating.

You might find a bug that is not listed here. Can you work out how to fix it?

üó£Ô∏è We love hearing about your bugs and how you fixed them. Use the **Send feedback** button at the bottom of this page and tell us if you found a different bug in your project.

What is your next step? It might be to add more code to your sprite. It might be to add code to another sprite. It might be to record a sound or create a new costume in the Paint editor. 

Are you stuck for ideas? Don't forget to look at step 3: [Get inspiration](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/from-me-to-you/2){:target="_blank"} and **See inside** some projects.

If you have finished or don't have much time left, then move on to the next step to share your digital card.
